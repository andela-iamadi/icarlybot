Slack bot: The plan

1. Converse with slack bot over a range of trigger words in dm

2. Retrieve conversation messages and process(using simple triggers for a start).

3. Register trigger words like 'register' and 'present' to be sent to a function that would process and send an ajax call to the rails server

4. Create APIs to handle the read, update and delete functions that are sure to be coming.

5. Test created APIs with POSTMAN

6. Integrate SlackBot to consume the APIs
